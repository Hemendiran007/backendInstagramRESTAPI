# BackEndInstagramRESTAPI
## Hi I am Hemendiran, I did a project on BackEnd Instagram REST API
#### Language used : Go     
#### Database used : MongoDB(storage) . It is is an open-source document database and leading NoSQL database
#### Connecting with mongoDB made by using : MongoDB Go Driver
#### Editor used for coding : Atom text Editor     
#### API Endpoint Testing platform : Postman tool
#### I developed a basic version of a Instagram. I did the backend API for the system (an HTTP JSON API capable). 
######  HTTP JSON API capable of the following operations, Below mentioned are the basic operations that I developed !!
###### 1.) User Creation - a POST request - uses JSON request body - uses a URL  ‘/users'
###### 2.) Get a User using id - a GET request - ID should be in the URL parameter - uses a URL ‘/users/{id}’
###### 3.) Creating a Post - a POST request - uses JSON request body - uses a URL ‘/posts'
###### 4.) Getting a Post using id - a GET request - uses JSON request body - uses a URL ‘/posts/{id}'
###### 5.) Getting Posts of all users - a GET request - uses a URL ‘/posts/users'

## Run this code by tpying "go run main.go" in your terminal, after connecting your mongoDB to your Go and then test your API with postman tool by giving appropriate request and URL to see the Output !!  :)
